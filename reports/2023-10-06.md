# Activities 
* Meeting with team about choosing between Twinmotion/ UE. 
* Watched FastAI tutorial #2 and created a model to ... and link... 
* Experimenting with current UE dataset (show code)
* Experimenting with maybe MuddHallway dataset (show code)
* Continued with FastAI and reading its documentation. 
* Started trying out different models in the first paper to compare resnet50, resnet34,... (show code)
* Rebuild Command+Image (ongoing)

# Issues
* The path to the datasets + how to test it easily (Francisco help)

# Research readings
* Read the first research paper and compare the pretrained models using jupyternotebook. 
* Experimenting with Command+Image.
