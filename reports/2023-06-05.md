# Activities
* Created account on gitea instance
* Watched fastai tutorial #1: 
   * <u> What I learned </u>: simple "stairs" image classifier model at lesson-01.ipynb. The model is going to differentiate whether the picture shows stairs or just a wall:

 * To test the model, I downoad a "stairs" picture

   * Link to the book: [link](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/tree/master)
   * Link to the forum: [link](https://forums.fast.ai/)
* Watched UE tutorial + meeting with Daisy and Anjali on creating simulation of Oldenborg
* Watched the video Prof Clark shared about Open Sound Control in UE to understand how the blueprint and workflow inside UE are like. 
# Issues:

```!pip install fastbook```

```!pip install -Uqq fastai duckduckgo_search```

# Plans
* Continue watching fastai tutorials
* Continue helping Anjali and joining meeting with Daisy for setting up Oldenborg simulation.
* Start reading papers to understand more deeply the conceptual architecture of deep learning.
