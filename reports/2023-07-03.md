# Summary

| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 06/28 | Weekly meeting. Finished MLOps #1. 
| 06/29 | Decided that will move on with SH3D. Worked on added stairs and ramps.
| 06/30 | Continued building the Oldenborg model.
| 06/31 | Joined meeting with Prof Clark, Francisco, and Anjali on UE Coding. Added the rails, door columns on Daisy's model. Started creating the table dimensions.
| 07/01 | Added missing stairs to the Oldenborf model. Started SWOT

# Activites
# 1. MLOps lesson:
Lesson 1: Introduce a business problem and develop a simple baseline. 
Lesson 2: Optimize the solution: introduce hyperparameter tuning (how to work in a team)
Lesson 3: Discuss model evaluation,

-> learn principle machine learning workflows. (ideas, artifacts, experiments, tables, sweeps, reports,...). Focusing on model development and evaluation, skip data collection

* W&B Tables
  * Visualize and analyze model predictions
  * Analyze and inspect tabular data including rich media such as images or videos.
  * Centralize exploratory data analysis
  * Do at the beginning or while training the data, can also use to compare the performance of experiments

* W&B Artifacts:
  * Lightweight dataset and model versioning with deduplication
  * track versions of your datasets and models.
  * Save every step of your pipeline and for reproduction. 

* W&B Experiments Management System
  * A system of record
  * Visualize and compare experiments, metrics,...

* W&B Reports: 
  * Collaborative dashboards
  * Add tables, visualizations + descriptions + live comments
  * Latex zip or pdf

# 2. The screenshot from the game package from Franciso:
* Issue resolved: the screenshots can be found at: ```~/Library/Application Support/Epic/ARCSAssets/Saved/Screenshots/Mac/ ```
  
# 3. Continued building Oldenborg with Sweet Home 3D 
* Added stairs & ramps created by Daisy using the position of these from the map by Anjali
* Imported railings and door columns
* Created a table to scale down the dimensions from the actual measurements

# Plans:
* Continue building Oldenborg in SH3D with the correct dimensions.
