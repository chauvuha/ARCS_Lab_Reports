2. Steps:
  * Log in to Pomona server
  * conda activate fastai (or the env that was created before)
  * Git clone repo: https://github.com/daisy-abbott/OldenborgTraining
  * Test script for training: python training.py test-perfect-random pkl-test "testing pkl export" resnet18 arcslaboratory/DoWellDatasets/Perfect-Random-Textures
  * After training, the trained model will be on wandb
  * To run inference: python inference.py ... etc
