# Summary

| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 07/17 | Discussed iGibson 2.0 paper. Talked about lab future plans and what set our research apart. Meeting with Francisco & Anjali on boxnav
| 07/18 | Meeting with Francisco and Daisy on creating artifact and experimenting with the data. Created the first artifact of the dataset in arcslaboratory
| 07/19 | Meeting with Oliver and his research team in UCSB: Talked about his plan and potential collaboration on reinforcement learning (unsupervised) with unreal engine


# 1. IGibson meeting:
* What is our research about: Observe how alterations in the environment may lead to erratic behavior or errors.
* That is why we would put humans, change meshes (floors, walls, maybe will be pedestrians, objects into the environments). 
* The reason we are using supervised learning is because we are actually trying to make the agent remembers the path. 

# 2. Boxnav
* Had a meeting with Anjali, Francisco, and Daisy on boxnav and UE game package.
* Went through how to run the commands, save images, and figured out path for port and robot configurations on Mac. 
* Running Boxnav:

  1. Create the conda environment
* conda activate unreal
* conda list (to check the libraries installed inside that environment

  2. Then install all the things inside the environment: python, python-osc, matplotlib, celluloid,
  
  * conda install python
  * conda install matplotlib celluloid
  * python -m pip install python-osc

  3. After that run:
  * python boxsim.py perfect 

  If the screen shows this, it should be good:

  After that, open UE game package, and run again.
  Run this final cmd: python boxsim.py perfect --anim_ext gif --save_images demo --ue

  And there should be screenshots saved.

* Game.ini file path:
  * On Mac:  ~/Library/Application Support/Epic/ARCSAssets/Saved/Config/Mac/Game.ini
  * On Windows: ~\07_14_Demo_Windows\ARCSAssets\Saved\Config\Windows
  * The file content:

# 3. Wandb practice & Artifact environments:
* We created the first artifact of the dataset in arcslaboratory
* I tried to create a data table, and experiment with it
* Split the data into Train, Test, and Valid by following the tutorials

# 4. Meeting notes:
Talked about plans:
* On reinforcement learning (unsupervised) with unreal engine.
* Multiple agents (robots, humans,....)
* Shared interest in applying to the real life world (like f1tenth…)
* Talked about Carla, OpenCV, and why we switched to OSC (more sustainable, constantly up to date)
* Talked about gymanism from OpenAI and how we should try it for unsupervised reinforcement learning.

# Plans:
* Meeting with Anjali, Francisco, Daisy, and Ella to discuss model training + artifact (naming, how to categorize artifacts,...)
* Train models with the new dataset from artifacts and try out reports
* Try out Blender
