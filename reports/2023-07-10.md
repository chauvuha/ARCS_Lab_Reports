# Summary

| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 07/05 | Continue watching videos in the WandB course
| 07/06 | Re-read research paper for team meeting. Reached out to team about our progress and plans discussed in the previous meeting that I missed. Experimented the new packaged game from Francisco
| 07/07 | Meeting with professor Clark on team progress, SWOT, and plans for the rest of the summer. Meeting with the whole team to discuss the research paper. 
| 07/08 | Fixed the code for ue5osc to save images to a specified path on MacOS. Made a pull request for the change

# Activities:

* In the OSC sender init, the function save_image() does not save the images to the specified path because it’s missing {self.path}. It would continue to save screenshots to the default hidden library.

* I changed the code, added {self.path} for it to work. Also, the command would require the full path “/Users/username/…“.
  
```(base) chauvu@Chaus-MacBook-Pro ue5osc % python demo.py /Users/chauvu/Desktop/new``` 

* This is the code after:

~~~python

def save_image_macos(self, filename: str = None) -> None:
        """Takes screenshot for MacOS with the default name."""
        self.img_number += 1
        filename =  f"{self.path}/{filename}" if filename else f"{self.path}/{self.img_number:06}"
        # Unreal Engine Needs a forward / to separate folder from the filenames
        self.client.send_message("/save/image", str(filename))
        sleep(1.5)
~~~

* Not sure if this is only a problem for mac, need to check if the changes still work on windows. So I changed the code to have both functions, one for mac and the original for windows.
* Created a fork of the repo, and add the arclaboratory as a remote you should be able to make a pull request. 
* This is what I got after changing the function:
    * I'm trying to screenshot a new image named "try20".

    * Ran "python demo /Users/chauvu/Desktop/new".
    * Now the screenshots will be saved the the "new" folder in Desktop:

# Plans:
* Continue reading the research paper iGibson 2.0.
* Check the other functions in the package.
