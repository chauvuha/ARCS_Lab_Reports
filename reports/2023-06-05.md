   * The link to the book: [link](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/tree/master)
* Watched UE tutorial + meeting with Daisy and Anjali on creating simulation of Oldenborg
* Watched the video Prof Clark shared about Open Sound Control in UE to understand how the blueprint and workflow inside UE are like. 
# Issues:
* Remember to install fastbook and duckduckgo_search with "!", because these two should be downloaded using a shell command. Fastbook is not already included with import fastai.vision.all
```!pip install fastbook```
```!pip install -Uqq fastai duckduckgo_search```

# Plans
* Continue watching fastai tutorials (super helfpful and help me grasp the practical application of deep learning quickly)
* Continue helping Anjali and joining meeting with Daisy for setting up Oldenborg simulation.
* Start reading papers to understand more deeply the conceptual architecture of deep learning.
