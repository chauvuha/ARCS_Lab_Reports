| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 06/14 | Team meeting on week tasks. Contributed to the Research Writeup
| 06/15 | Modified the code from Christy's CmdClassification.py so that it works on jupyternotebook. Ran it on uniform-full dataset first.
| 06/15 | Customized the code for Command+Image so that I can run it to train with the 2ndRunHighRes dataset.
| 06/16 | Team meeting for feedbacks on Command+Image and next steps. Meeting with Anjali to discuss how I modified the model
| 06/17 | Start to experiment with Sweet Home 3D and how to create game package so that I can create dataset remotely. Meeting with Daisy about this.


# Activities
* I worked on the Image+Command code in Christy's repository. However, there are several changes that need to be made before I could run the file:
    1. The ImageWithCmdDataset class only expects one argument, so when I created an instance of ImageWithCmdDataset in the main() function, I need to remove the first argument "classes". 
    2. The dataset path needs to be renamed to "data/clark/data/summer2021/datasets".
    3. Also need to import the library ```from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, SubsetRandomSampler``` in order to use Dataset for the ImageWithCmdDataset class. This library is missing at first.
    4. learner needs to be renamed to Learner because fastai has updated it.
    5. After training the revised the model with the dataset uniform-full, I got this result. The valid score is very high (~99%), which is indeed higher than the other basic CNN models I have tried before.

* Fix the code so that I can train over 2ndRunHighRes dataset. The only difference between the two dataset is how we format the files' name so I made some changes to the code: 
[code]
    * Here are the results after training:
[code]
    * Now there are new folders in the 2ndRunHighRes folder: cmd_model, cmd_data, cmd_model_fixed, cmd_data_fixed (because I accidentally run on the old function the first time, so cmd_model and cmd_data are actually errors that need to be removed)

* Experiment with Sweet Home 3D
