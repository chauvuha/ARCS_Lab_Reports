# Activities
* Created account on gitea instance
* Watched fastai tutorial #1: 
   * <u> What I learned </u>: I applied the lesson and built a "stairs" detection model at lesson-01.ipynb. The model is going to differentiate whether the picture shows stairs or just a wall. I created a Datablock, a learner, and how to train the model:

 * To test the model, I downoad a "stairs" picture (pretty obvious it's stairs)

  * This is how the model intepreted it (I think it did a pretty good job):

   * The link to the book: [link](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/tree/master)
   * The link to the forum: [link](https://forums.fast.ai/)
* Watched UE tutorial + meeting with Daisy and Anjali on creating simulation of Oldenborg
* Watched the video Prof Clark shared about Open Sound Control in UE to understand how the blueprint and workflow inside UE are like. 
# Issues:
* Remember to install fastbook and duckduckgo_search with "!", because these two should be downloaded using a shell command. Fastbook is not already included with import fastai.vision.all

```!pip install fastbook```

```!pip install -Uqq fastai duckduckgo_search```

# Plans
* Continue watching fastai tutorials (super helfpful and help me grasp the practical application of deep learning quickly)
* Continue helping Anjali and joining meeting with Daisy for setting up Oldenborg simulation.
* Start reading papers to understand more deeply the conceptual architecture of deep learning.
