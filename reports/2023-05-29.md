# Activities
* Installed VPN, Epic Game Launcher, Unreal Engine 5, and linked to Visual Code Studio. 
* Also tried to follow Christy's setup section in this [repo](https://github.com/christymarc/ARCS_Reports/blob/master/guidance/2023-04-27-research-process.md) and Professor Clark's [tutorial](https://compusciencing.github.io/unrealcv-ue5-windows.html) to clone the lab repositories I need in order to have an agent move through a UE5 project. However, I ran into issue described in the next section.
* Watched fastai tutorial #1: 
   * Trained a bird detection model at lesson-01.ipynb. 
   * Learned to download image, create a DataBlock, and Learner.
   * The link to the book: [link](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/tree/master)
* Watched UE tutorial + meeting with Daisy and Anjali on creating simulation of Oldenborg

# Issues
* I installed mamba, have access and activated the conda environment.
*  While trying to setup UnrealCV, when I tried to compile the plugin by running
```python build.py --UE4 "/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.2```, the log indicated that my code broke here:

* Possible explanations: 
  * The AutomationTool, which is a part of Unreal Engine's build system, encountered an error and was unable to run successfully. The specific ExitCode=6 indicates a failure. UnrealCV may not compatible/very optimal for Unreal Engine 5.0, usually for 4.0. 
  * A shadowing error in the file LevelEditorViewport.h related to the symbol "Pending." This error occurs when a declaration in a local scope shadows a declaration in the global namespace. The file LevelEditorViewport.h contains core engine files for Unreal Engine development and should not be modified.
