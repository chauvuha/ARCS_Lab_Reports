Saliency Paper: 

* Objective: Address catastrophic forgetting in artificial learning systems.

* Traditional Approach: Experience replay stores past examples in episodic memory for replay during new task learning.
* Challenge: Performance suffers as episodic memory size decreases.
* Proposed Method - EPR (Experience Packing and Replay):
    * Selects past experiences using saliency maps, providing visual explanations for model decisions.
    * Packs memory with patches of images crucial for the model's prediction, identified by saliency maps.
    * Utilizes Experience Packing Factor (EPF) to determine the number and size of memory patches per class.
    * During new task learning, replays memory patches with zero-padding to remind the model of past decisions.
    * Evaluation: Tested on CIFAR-100, miniImageNet, and CUB datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

* Contributions:
  * Leverages explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically saliency methods, for improved experience replay.
  * Introduces EPF to enhance sample diversity without increasing memory size.
  * Comparison with existing methods in online task-incremental and class-incremental scenarios shows superior performance.
