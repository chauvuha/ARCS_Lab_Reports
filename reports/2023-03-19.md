# Summary

| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| Mar 19 | Learned how to solder, use safty soldering tools, and create dupont connectors. 
| Mar 13 | Separated each servo and set a different value to stop those
| Mar 3 | Modified the WifiAccessPoint codes to get the local server display information, fixed "Failed uploading: uploading error: exit status 2" 



# Activities
* Created dupont connectors to connect the battery to the switch without having to solder it directly.
* Learned how to solder and use soldering safety tools. Tools include
  + Solder fume absorber: On. Keep the temperature around 750 ~ 790 depending whether we solder/ desolder
  + Board holder
  + Metal strips (to be melted while soldering)
  + Cleaning sponge after soldering

# Plans
* Next meeting: Continue implementing the 3-way switch to control battery -> make the motor driver function without the wire plugged to the computer. 
  + Solder the black wire to the microcontroller.

* Long-term: Use other sensors (GPS, display screen, distance - measure the distance between hands and robot)
