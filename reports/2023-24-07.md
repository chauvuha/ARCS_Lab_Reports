| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 07/17 | Discussed iGibson 2.0 paper. Talked about lab future plans and what set our research apart. Meeting with Francisco & Anjali on boxnav
| 07/18 | Meeting with Francisco and Daisy on creating artifact and experimenting with the data. Created the first artifact of the dataset in arcslaboratory
| 07/19 | Meeting with Oliver and his research team in UCSB: Talked about his plan and potential collaboration on reinforcement learning (unsupervised) with unreal engine


# 1. IGibson meeting:
What is our research about: Observe how alterations in the environment may lead to erratic behavior or errors. That is why we would put humans, change meshes (floors, walls, maybe will be pedestrians, objects into the environments). 
The reason we are using supervised learning is because we are actually trying to make the agent remembers the path. 

# 2. Boxnav
Had a meeting with Anjali, Francisco, and Daisy on boxnav and UE game package. We went through how to run the commands, save images, and figured out path for port and robot configurations on Mac 
The path is…

# 3. Wandb practice & Artifact environments:
We created the first artifact of the dataset in arcslaboratory
I tried to create a data table, and experiment with it
Split the data into Train, Test, and Valid by following the tutorials

# 4. Meeting notes:
Talked about plans:
* On reinforcement learning (unsupervised) with unreal engine.
* Multiple agents (robots, humans,....)
* Shared interest in applying to the real life world (like f1tenth…)
* Talked about Carla, OpenCV, and why we switched to OSC (more sustainable, constantly up to date)
* Talked about gymanism from OpenAI and how we should try it for unsupervised reinforcement learning.
