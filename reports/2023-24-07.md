| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 07/17 | Discussed iGibson 2.0 paper. Talked about lab future plans and what set our research apart. Meeting with Francisco & Anjali on boxnav
| 07/18 | Meeting with Francisco and Daisy on creating artifact and experimenting with the data. Created the first artifact of the dataset in arcslaboratory
| 07/19 | Meeting with Oliver and his research team in UCSB: Talked about his plan and potential collaboration on reinforcement learning (unsupervised) with unreal engine


# 1. IGibson meeting:
* What is our research about: Observe how alterations in the environment may lead to erratic behavior or errors.
* That is why we would put humans, change meshes (floors, walls, maybe will be pedestrians, objects into the environments). 
* The reason we are using supervised learning is because we are actually trying to make the agent remembers the path. 

# 2. Boxnav
* Had a meeting with Anjali, Francisco, and Daisy on boxnav and UE game package.
* Went through how to run the commands, save images, and figured out path for port and robot configurations on Mac 
* Running Boxnav:

  > python boxsim.py perfect max_actions 200 –ue –save_images {path} anim_ext .gif

* Game.ini file path:
  * On Mac:  ~/Library/Application Support/Epic/ARCSAssets/Saved/Config/Mac/Game.ini
  * On Windows: ~\07_14_Demo_Windows\ARCSAssets\Saved\Config\Windows
  * The file content:

  
[/ARCSRobots/SimpleRobotCamera/BP_Pawn_SimpleRobotCamera.BP_Pawn_SimpleRobotCamera_C]

UEPort=7447

PyPort=7001

RobotVisible=True


# 3. Wandb practice & Artifact environments:
* We created the first artifact of the dataset in arcslaboratory
* I tried to create a data table, and experiment with it
* Split the data into Train, Test, and Valid by following the tutorials

# 4. Meeting notes:
Talked about plans:
* On reinforcement learning (unsupervised) with unreal engine.
* Multiple agents (robots, humans,....)
* Shared interest in applying to the real life world (like f1tenth…)
* Talked about Carla, OpenCV, and why we switched to OSC (more sustainable, constantly up to date)
* Talked about gymanism from OpenAI and how we should try it for unsupervised reinforcement learning.

# Plans:
* Meeting with Anjali, Francisco, Daisy, and Ella to discuss model training + artifact (naming, how to categorize files,...)
