# Plans:
* Hot glue the switch with 3 red wires
* Put everything in the box

# Notes:
* Note down how to charge the battery for 1. the micro-controller and 2. the motor driver (reference the first report)
* How to test the battery (3.7 -> 4.2 = fully charged; < 3.5 = undercharged) 
* Connect to the WifiAccessPoint and try running it.
