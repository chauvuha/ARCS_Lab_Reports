# Activities
*  Planned the next steps - remaining works

# Plans
* Before next meeting: Continue with step 4 and 5.
    1. Write a simple sketch to control the motors 
    2. Find the stop signal for each motor (modify by a little each time)
    3. Remotely control the motor using the wifi access point
    4. Create the wiring needed for the battery 
        + Solder the black wire to the charging board with the heat shrink
        + One side of all three black wires needs to have dupont connector
    5. Make the cardboard box (put everything in) + the wheels attached 
    6. Control the cardboard robot from wifi
    7. Write code for additional sensors and outputs
        + Distance sensors
        + Output display 
        + IMU (gyroscope, accelerometer compass)
        + GPS
    8. Make the robot autonomous inside
    9. Make the robot autonomous outside (GPS)
