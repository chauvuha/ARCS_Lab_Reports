# 1. Activities

# 1.1. Experiment with W&B functionalities:

* Several notes:
  * Weights & Biases were there to keep track of the problems that might arise when we train the models (whether it is parameters tuning or the training process, etc).
  * Extra exciting things that we can do include:
      * Visualize how parameters (training time, or a number of batches, epochs, etc,...) can affect the performance of the model.
      * Sweeps in W&B can help choose the best hyperparameters for the model. 

* I was experimenting to see if there is a correlation between the number of epochs and performance in terms of loss in the first graph.

* And we can also create reports to share with others very quickly because the graphs have been imported automatically.

# 1.2. Work with the UE Mac package + Experiment with the commands: 
* Several notes:
  * ke * texture [0-2] [0-40]. 
    * 0: Floor
    * 1: Wall
    * 2: Ceiling
  * pythonosc is not installed: pip install pythonosc.

# 1.3 Experimented with Archicad
* Several notes:
  * Needs a license to use free. I have requested an education license with my pomona email, however, I have not heard back from them. It can take up to 5 days to process.
  * Instead I tried with the free demo version. This version does not allow me to save or copy the project so I was only able to try several functionalities.
 * Cons:
  * Definitely more complicated than SH3D.
  * Needs time to get familiar.
  * The walls are harder to create
  * Have not found a way to put the map as a blueprint. 
* Pros:
 * More complicated but many more options for textures, angles, furniture,... 
 * Very easy to create slopes, or inclines, different levels, and footings, which are beneficial when we recreate the Oldy model. (pictures below)

# Issues:
* Screenshots is the only function that is not working both from repository and game console (E or F). -> How to print out and troubleshoot?
