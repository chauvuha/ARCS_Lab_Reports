| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 06/14 | Team meeting on week tasks. Made some suggestions to the research writeup
| 06/15 | Modified the code from Christy's CmdClassification.py so that it works on jupyternotebook. Ran it on uniform-full dataset first.
| 06/15 | Customized the code for Command+Image so that I can run it to train with the 2ndRunHighRes dataset.
| 06/16 | Team meeting for feedbacks on my Command+Image and next steps. Meeting with Anjali to discuss how I modified the model
| 06/17 | Meeting with Daisy about experimenting with Sweet Home 3D. Created an Oldenborg model on Sweet Home 3D. Import my model to UE.


# Activities
# 1. Customize Image+Command code to train the 2ndRunHighRes dataset
I worked on the Image+Command code in Christy's repository. However, there are several changes that need to be made before I could run the file:
    1. The ImageWithCmdDataset class only expects one argument, so when I created an instance of ImageWithCmdDataset in the main() function, I need to remove the first argument "classes". 
    2. The dataset path needs to be renamed to "data/clark/data/summer2021/datasets".
    3. Also need to import the library ```from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, SubsetRandomSampler``` in order to use Dataset for the ImageWithCmdDataset class. This library is missing at first.
    4. learner needs to be renamed to Learner because fastai has updated it.
    5. After training the revised the model with the dataset uniform-full, I got this result. The valid score is very high (~99%), which is indeed higher than the other basic CNN models I have tried before.

* For the next step, I modify this file so that I can train over the 2ndRunHighRes dataset. The only difference between the two dataset is how we format the files' name so I made some changes to the code:

   * Here are the results after training:

   * Now there are new folders in the 2ndRunHighRes folder: cmd_model, cmd_data, cmd_model_fixed, cmd_data_fixed (because I accidentally run on the old function the first time, so cmd_model and cmd_data are actually errors that need to be removed)

# 2. Experiment with Sweet Home 3D
* My notes after experimenting with Sweet Home 3D:
    * Very easy to use & not laggy
    * Can import floorplan and create rooms very easily.
    * Just enough furniture
    * Can be exported and imported to UE

* Maybe try to import into UE.

# 3. Others
* I followed the tutorial on how to create a game package in UE on MacOS in this link that prof Clark suggested: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vcF07IuLyE). It took pretty long, 20 minutes for the shaders to compile but worked at the end:

* I tried to export the model as obj. file and imported to UE.

# Plans:
* Try to import the Sweet Home 3D model into UE.
