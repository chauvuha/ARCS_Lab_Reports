| 10/22 | met with Chau and Francisco to discuss meeting with Oliver and our question
| 10/26 |	met with Oliver and go through our plans of collaboration

# Activities:
1. Meeting with Oliver:
   * Do literature: How we can incorporate saliency in our models (supervised vs unsupervised)
   * How to adapt gymnasium env to our work (boxnav) - slight priority

2. Look over adapting the raycast simulator to make a custom gymnasium environment. To start, we can focus on image based observations.
3. Start doing literature review on using saliency mapping as an efficient method to store data in memory:
   * Read this paper: Saliency Guided Experience Packing for Replay in Continual Learning (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Saha_Saliency_Guided_Experience_Packing_for_Replay_in_Continual_Learning_WACV_2023_paper.pdf)

# To-dos:
* Continue doing literature review
* Work with Ella & Francisco on creating gym
