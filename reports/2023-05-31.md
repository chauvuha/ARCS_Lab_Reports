# Activities
* Installed VPN, Epic Game Launcher, Unreal Engine, and linked to Visual Code Studio. 
* Also tried to follow Christy's setup section in this [repo](https://github.com/christymarc/ARCS_Reports/blob/master/guidance/2023-04-27-research-process.md) and Professor Clark's [tutorial](https://compusciencing.github.io/unrealcv-ue5-windows.html) to clone the lab repositories I need in order to have an agent move through a UE5 project. However, I ran into issue described in the next section.
* Watched fastai tutorial. Started by training a bird detection model at lesson-01.ipynb

# Issues
* I installed mamba, have access and activated the conda environment. While trying to setup UnrealCV, when I tried to compile the plugin by running ```python build.py --UE4 "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.0```, the log indicated that my code broke here:
```/Users/chauvu/unrealcv/Plugins/UnrealCV/HostProject/Plugins/UnrealCV/Intermediate/Build/Mac/arm64/UnrealEditor/Development/UnrealCV/Module.UnrealCV.cpp:24:
