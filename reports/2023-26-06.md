# 1. Activities

# 1.1. Experiment with W&B functionalities:

* Several notes:
  * Weights & Biases were there to keep track of the problems that might arise when we train the models (whether it is parameters tuning or the training process, etc).
  * Extra exciting things that we can do include:
      * Visualize how parameters (training time, or a number of batches, epochs, etc,...) can affect the performance of the model.
      * Sweeps in W&B can help choose the best hyperparameters for the model. 

* I was experimenting to see if there is a correlation between the number of epochs and performance in terms of loss in the first graph.

* And we can also create reports to share with others very quickly because the graphs have been imported automatically.

# 1.2. Work with the UE Mac package + Experiment with the commands: 
* Several notes:
  * ke * texture [0-2] [0-40]. 
    * 0: Floor
    * 1: Wall
    * 2: Ceiling
  * pythonosc is not installed: pip install pythonosc.

# Issues:
* Screenshots is the only function that is not working both from repository and game console (E or F). -> How to print out and troubleshoot?
