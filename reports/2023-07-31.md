# Summary

| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| 07/24 | Meeting with the whole team on weekly tasks. Then meeting Daisy and Ella and figured out together how to allocate GPUs on the server. 
| 07/25 | Meeting with Ella and Daisy on Img+Cmd model. Made a pull request on how to train the new 1k+ dataset on Img+Cmd.
| 07/26 | Added more to the Img+Cmd mode: Modified the training script, and figured out how to add the model as an artifact so that Francisco and Anjali can pull it down for inference. Modified the pull request.
| 07/27 | Meeting with Ella and Daisy on the error that Francisco and Anjali was getting while running Img+Cmd code for inference. Meet with Francisco and Anjali later to discuss those. 
| 07/27 | Meeting with Ella and Daisy to continue working on the error. Meeting with Francisco later to see in live share the errors we were running into.

# Activites:
# 1. Allocate GPU command:

* Meeting with Daisy and Ella to work on allocating the GPU.
* The command:
```
torch.cuda.set_device(2) 
print("Running on GPU: " + str(torch.cuda.current_device()))
```

* The 3rd GPU is being used:

# 2. Img+Cmd model on new dataset + Wandb Artifact
* The latest model is at this PR: https://github.com/arcslaboratory/OldenborgTraining/pull/3/files
  
# Changes:
* Modified the original Img+Cmd classfication code to work with the new 1k+ dataset from Francisco and Anjali:
 * Added img_size and valid_pct as arguments to the training script.
 * Converted img_size, valid_pct from string to float
 * Renamed CommandModel for clarity
 * Changed os.path to pathlib
 * Added documentation on cmd_model

* Fracisco also uploaded a new dataset with different naming, where he added the number of trials in the front of each file:
https://wandb.ai/arcslaboratory/wandering-random-2K+/artifacts/dataset/07-26_wandering_10Trials_randomized/v0/files/data
* We changed the code to work with this new dataset:
  ```
  angle = float(filename_str.split("/")[-1].split("_")[2].split(".")[0].replace("p", "."))
  ```

* Command to be used when running the file:
  * python CmdImageClassification-test-largedataset resnet34 'data' --pretrained

# Issues:
* The errors we were getting:

1. PosixPath

<img width="915" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 12 20 07 AM" src="https://github.com/chauvuha/ARCS_Lab_Reports/assets/79251745/fae023f0-ec06-4836-b960-9af56c0ba695"> 

   
* Solution: Fixed it by putting str in front:

```
           # Getting the current image's label
        label_name = filename_to_class(str(img_filename))
        label = self.class_indices[label_name]
        
        # Getting the previous image's label
        # The default is 'forward'
        cmd_name = 'forward'
        
        # If the index is not 0, the cmd is determined by the previous img_filename
        if index != 0:
            prev_img_filename = self.all_filenames[index-1]
            cmd_name = filename_to_class(str(prev_img_filename))            
        cmd = self.class_indices[cmd_name]
```
* The models are saved after training:

2. Could not convert string to float: '10Trials':

<img width="569" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-28 at 11 09 54 PM" src="https://github.com/chauvuha/ARCS_Lab_Reports/assets/79251745/b8f8ea6c-0281-4335-9926-ecbc2306ae1b">

* Solution: Printed out the full filename path. Turned out that the code was getting the whole path from Home. We split the path, get only the string at index -1, and keep the rest the same: 
``` angle = float(filename_str.split("/")[-1].split("_")[2].split(".")[0].replace("p", ".")) ```


3. When Francisco tried to download our model and use inside the inference.py file, we are getting this error:

  ```
(unreal) PS C:\Users\alnj2022\Documents\VisualStudioCode\OldenborgTraining> python inference.py C:\Users\alnj2022\Downloads\classification-resnet34-pretrained-1.pth UE_Screenshots
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\alnj2022\Documents\VisualStudioCode\OldenborgTraining\inference.py", line 95, in <module>
    main()
  File "C:\Users\alnj2022\Documents\VisualStudioCode\OldenborgTraining\inference.py", line 55, in main
    learn = load_learner(args.model)
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "c:\Users\alnj2022\.conda\envs\unreal\Lib\site-packages\fastai\learner.py", line 451, in load_learner
    res.dls.cpu()
    ^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'collections.OrderedDict' object has no attribute 'dls'
  ```

* (Possible) solutions:
  * The model was not saved and exported in the original Img+Cmd Classification code. So we could try exporting the model before learner.load() with this command: learn.export(model.pkl)

# Plans:
* Look into the angle thresholds, boxnax, and fix this in the filename_to_class() function.
* Continue looking into why the model is not exported properly to used in inference.py
* Look into Blender
* Figure out how to compare loss, epoch across different runs in wandb
