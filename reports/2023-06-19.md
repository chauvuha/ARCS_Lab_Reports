| 06/15 | Modified the code from Christy's CmdClassification.py so that it works on jupyternotebook. Ran it on uniform-full first.

# Activities
* I worked on the Image+Command code in Christy's repository. However, there are several changes that need to be made before I could run the file:
    1. The file is written for a CUDA-enabled GPU right now. Therefore, I modified the code so that I can run in my jupyter notebook: change to ImageDataLoaders like the BasicCNN.py
    2. The ImageWithCmdDataset class only expects one argument, so when I created an instance of ImageWithCmdDataset in the main() function, I need to remove the first argument "classes". 
    3. Also need to import the library ```from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, SubsetRandomSampler``` in order to use Dataset for the ImageWithCmdDataset class. This library is missing at first.
    4. learner needs to be renamed to cnn_learn or vision_learn because fastai has updated it.
    5. This is my code after revising. I trained with resnet18 and the dataset uniform-full. I also changed the Epoch number to 2 instead of 8:
