# Summary

| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
| Mar 13 | Separated each servo and set a different value to stop those
| Mar 8 | Modified the WifiAccessPoint codes to get the local server display information


# Activities
* Find the pwm value of the continuous motor that can stop the motor and put it in the wifi server.
* Altered the code in WifiAccessPoint sample so that we can click the HTML buttons to make the servos move forward, backward, and stop.

# Issues
* The servos are still (sometimes) vibrating after resetting the Arduino server -> needs to modify pwm values slightly by 1 to 2 each time.

# Plans
* Implement the 3-way battery to make the motor driver function without the wire plugged to the computer. The diagram is as follows:

* Long-term: Use other sensors (GPS, display screen, distance - measure the distance between hands and robot)
